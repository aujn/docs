description: 'Read DsReplay’s comprehensive Privacy Policy outlining how we collect, use, and protect your personal data. Fully compliant with UK GDPR, EU, and global data protection laws.'
---

Effective Date: 15, August 2025

## **1. Introduction**

This Privacy Policy sets out the basis upon which DsReplay (“we”, “us”, or “our”) processes your personal data when you access or use our website, platform, and associated services, including but not limited to replay simulations, trading analytics, session management tools, and related customer support services (collectively, the “Services”).

We are firmly committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal data in accordance with the obligations set out in the **UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)**, the **Data Protection Act 2018**, and where applicable, the **EU GDPR** and other relevant laws concerning privacy and data protection.

### 1.1 Who We Are

DsReplay is a digital analytics and trading simulation platform designed for individuals and organisations who wish to backtest and replay trading scenarios using synthetic financial instruments. Our services are delivered entirely through a secure online platform and are accessible globally. DsReplay is operated by DsLabs Ventures.

In providing our Services, we collect and process personal data from users, which may include individuals acting in their personal capacity (i.e., retail users), as well as representatives of corporate entities (e.g., traders, analysts, financial professionals, or researchers using DsReplay for institutional purposes).

### 1.2 Our Commitment to Privacy

We understand that the nature of our business involves handling sensitive data, including user behaviour, trading patterns, strategy configurations, and account information. Our commitment to privacy is not merely legalistic but intrinsic to the trust our users place in us. As such, we implement best-practice data governance procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal information.

We treat your data with the highest level of care, apply strict access controls, use industry-standard encryption, and conduct periodic risk assessments to prevent data breaches, unauthorised access, or misuse.

### 1.3 Who This Policy Applies To

This Privacy Policy applies to you if:

* You visit or browse the DsReplay website or application;
* You create a DsReplay account or otherwise register with us;
* You interact with any of our Services, whether as a paid subscriber or free trial user;
* You communicate with us via email, chat, or support channels;
* You are a prospective customer, business partner, or vendor;
* You provide us with personal data in any context, whether commercial or otherwise.

This Policy is intended to provide transparency about our data processing activities and your legal rights. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

This Privacy Policy **does not** extend to third-party websites, platforms, APIs, or services that may be linked to or embedded within DsReplay, including but not limited to payment providers, external data feeds, or trading integration partners. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties and encourage you to review their privacy policies before disclosing any personal data to them.

Similarly, if you are using DsReplay through a corporate account or as a sub-user under an enterprise agreement, your employer or principal organisation may act as a separate data controller. In such cases, please consult your organisation’s own data protection policy to understand how they process your data.

### 1.5 Lawful Basis for Processing

All personal data we collect is processed on a lawful basis as defined by applicable legislation. These bases include:

* **Consent** – where you have explicitly agreed to the processing of your data for a specific purpose (e.g., newsletter subscription).
* **Contractual necessity** – where the processing is necessary to perform our contractual obligations to you (e.g., account provisioning, subscription billing).
* **Legal obligation** – where we are required to process data to comply with legal or regulatory mandates (e.g., anti-fraud, record-keeping).
* **Legitimate interests** – where processing is necessary for our legitimate business interests and those interests are not overridden by your data protection rights (e.g., analytics, platform performance monitoring, fraud detection).

We conduct routine assessments of these lawful bases to ensure continued compliance and will update this policy if our processing purposes change.

### 1.6 Updates to This Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal requirements, best practices, or updates to our Services. All changes will be published on our website with a clearly marked revision date. In the event of material changes (e.g., new processing purposes, international data transfers, third-party integrations), we will take reasonable steps to notify you directly.

Your continued use of the Services following the publication of updates will constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the revised policy. You are encouraged to review this policy regularly to remain informed about how we protect your information.


## **2. Data Controller Contact Information**

For the purposes of the **UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)**, the **Data Protection Act 2018**, and other applicable data protection and privacy legislation, the entity responsible for determining the purposes and means of processing your personal data—referred to as the **Data Controller**—is:

We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month. In cases of complex or voluminous requests, this period may be extended in accordance with Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR, and we shall notify you accordingly.

### **2.2 Data Protection Officer (DPO)**

Although not legally required for all data controllers under Article 37 of the UK GDPR, DsReplay has appointed a designated individual responsible for overseeing compliance with data protection obligations. This individual acts in an advisory and supervisory capacity within our organisation and serves as a point of escalation for any privacy-related concerns.

We do not intentionally collect **special category data** under Article 9 of the UK GDPR (e.g., health data, ethnicity, political opinions), and request that users refrain from submitting such data unless explicitly requested and justified.


## **4. How We Collect Your Data**

DsReplay collects personal data through various methods to deliver and support our services. Data may be collected directly from you, automatically via your use of the platform, or indirectly through third-party providers and integrations. This section outlines each method and the rationale for its use.


### **4.1 Direct Collection**

We collect personal data directly from you when you voluntarily submit it to us. This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Account registration**: When you sign up for an account on DsReplay, you provide personal identifiers such as your name, email address, and password.
* **Platform usage**: When you manually configure settings, start replay sessions, or input trading strategies and parameters.
* **Payment and billing**: When you subscribe to paid plans and input payment details or billing address (processed via third-party processors).
* **Customer support**: When you contact us via email, chat, or ticketing systems for assistance or to report issues.
* **Feedback and forms**: When you participate in surveys, beta testing, early access programs, or submit feedback through our feedback mechanisms.

In all such instances, you will typically know what data is being collected because you are the one submitting it.


### **4.2 Automated Collection (Passive Collection)**

Certain types of data are collected automatically when you interact with DsReplay. This helps us maintain platform security, optimise performance, and better understand user behaviour. These include:

* **Cookies and local storage**: Used to maintain session state, remember preferences, and enable analytics. For details, see Section 10 (Cookies & Tracking Technologies).
* **Server logs**: Capture IP address, time of access, URL requests, browser version, and user agent string.
* **Usage analytics**: Using tools like Google Analytics, Sentry, or self-hosted trackers (if applicable) to understand aggregate usage behaviour and UI interactions.
* **Replay telemetry**: In the context of simulations or backtesting sessions, we may automatically log which features are used, replay parameters selected, and the frequency of certain operations.


### **4.3 Third-Party Data Sources**

We may obtain personal data about you from third-party sources where lawful and necessary to provide our services. This includes:

* **Payment processors** (e.g., Stripe, Polar): Confirmation of payment status, subscription plan, and transaction references.
* **Authentication or identity providers** (e.g., Discord, Twitter, Google Sign-In): Where single sign-on or federated login methods are enabled, we may receive basic profile data subject to your consent and the provider’s terms.
* **Marketing platforms**: If you arrived at DsReplay via an affiliate or referral link, certain attribution data may be shared with us for performance tracking and compliance.
* **Business tools**: If you interact with us via integrations (e.g., Notion), those platforms may share communication metadata with us.

In all such cases, we ensure that the third parties involved are themselves compliant with applicable privacy laws, and we do not request more data than is strictly necessary.


### **4.4 Combined and Derived Data**

We may combine data collected through the methods above to create derived insights for internal use, such as:

* Usage intensity or frequency scoring
* Feature adoption metrics
* Subscription lifecycle analytics
* Strategy simulation patterns

Where these derived datasets are pseudonymised or anonymised, they fall outside the scope of personal data regulation. Where identifiable, they are handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


### **4.5 Data Provided on Behalf of Others**

If you are an administrator of an organisation account, or if you invite other users to collaborate in a workspace or simulation, you may provide data relating to those individuals. You represent and warrant that you have obtained any necessary consents and that you are authorised to share such information with us.

We act as a processor of such data and will treat it in accordance with our obligations under applicable law and any service-level agreements in place.


## **5. Purposes of Data Processing**

## **6. Lawful Bases for Processing**

Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), we must ensure that every instance of processing personal data is supported by at least one of the lawful bases set out in Article 6 of the Regulation. The lawful basis we rely upon depends on the specific context and purpose of the processing activity.

This section details the legal grounds DsReplay relies on, along with real-world examples of their application in our operations.


### **6.1 Contractual Necessity (Article 6(1)(b))**

We process your data when it is necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you. Without this data, we would not be able to provide you with access to or fulfil the functionality of the DsReplay platform.

**Examples:**

* Creating and managing your user account.
* Providing access to replay tools and analytical features.
* Processing your subscription payments.
* Responding to your support tickets as part of service delivery.

**Important Note**: If you do not provide the data necessary for us to perform our contract, we may be unable to provide you with access to our services.


### **6.2 Consent (Article 6(1)(a))**

In some cases, we will seek your clear and informed consent before processing your personal data. You have the right to withdraw consent at any time, and this will not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to the withdrawal.

**Examples:**

* Sending you marketing or promotional emails.
* Collecting optional analytics through non-essential cookies.
* Participating in surveys or feedback programmes.

**How we obtain consent:**

* Through clearly worded prompts during registration, or when configuring preferences.
* Via opt-in checkboxes or toggles (never pre-ticked).
* Through cookie banners for online tracking tools.


### **6.3 Legal Obligation (Article 6(1)(c))**

We process data when we are legally required to do so, for example under UK tax law, accounting rules, or other regulatory obligations.

**Examples:**

* Maintaining accurate financial and tax records.
* Responding to lawful requests from regulators, courts, or police.
* Screening payments for potential fraud or sanctions compliance.

**Data Retention**: Where this basis applies, data may be retained for longer periods as required by law (e.g., up to 6 years for tax documentation under HMRC rules).


### **6.4 Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f))**

We may process your data when it is necessary for our legitimate interests, provided that such interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms. Where we rely on this basis, we conduct a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA) to ensure a balanced approach.

**Examples:**

* Monitoring platform usage to optimise user experience.
* Preventing fraud or system abuse.
* Communicating service updates or changes to terms.
* Analysing anonymised or pseudonymised data to improve performance.

**Your Rights**: You have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests. If you do so, we will reassess and, in most cases, cease such processing unless we can demonstrate compelling overriding grounds.


### **6.5 Vital Interests (Article 6(1)(d))**

Although rare in the context of DsReplay, we may process your data if it is necessary to protect someone’s life or physical safety.

**Example (hypothetical):**

* If we are alerted to a credible risk of harm involving one of our users and must share information with emergency services.


### **6.6 Public Task (Article 6(1)(e))**

This basis applies to data processing carried out in the public interest or under official authority. **DsReplay does not typically rely on this basis**, as we are a private-sector service provider.


### **Children’s Data and Age Restrictions**

DsReplay is not intended for children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect or process data from individuals below this age. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will take prompt steps to delete it.


### **Special Category Data (Article 9)**

We do **not** intentionally collect or process any special category data, such as health information, religious beliefs, political opinions, or biometric identifiers. If you voluntarily submit such information, it will be deleted unless we have a lawful and explicit basis to retain it.


## **7. How We Share Your Data**

At DsReplay, we treat your personal data with strict confidentiality. We do not sell or rent your information under any circumstances. However, in order to operate effectively, meet regulatory obligations, and deliver a high-quality experience, we may need to share your data with specific third parties. This section explains who those parties are, under what circumstances data may be shared, and the safeguards we employ.


### **7.1 Data Processors and Service Providers**

We may share personal data with trusted third-party service providers who act as *data processors* on our behalf. These providers are only permitted to process your data under our explicit instructions and are contractually bound to maintain appropriate confidentiality, security, and data protection standards.

**Categories of service providers include:**

* **Cloud hosting providers** (e.g., Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean, Vercel): For secure storage, platform deployment, and scalability.
* **Analytics and telemetry tools** (e.g., Plausible, PostHog, Sentry): To monitor system performance and usage trends.
* **Payment processors** (e.g., Stripe, Polar): To handle subscription payments and financial reconciliation.
* **Email and notification systems** (e.g., Mailgun): For transactional messages, alerts, and communication.
* **Customer support platforms** (e.g., Chatwoot): For handling support requests and user queries.
* **CRM or billing providers**: To manage customer relationships and invoicing where applicable.

All processors are required to:

* Process data only under our instructions.
* Implement robust technical and organisational measures.
* Never use the data for their own purposes.


### **7.2 Group Companies and Corporate Affiliates**

Where DsReplay is operated as part of a group of companies, or if we establish legally affiliated entities, personal data may be shared internally within that group. This is done solely for internal administrative purposes, technical support, or business continuity.

All such transfers will:

* Be covered by appropriate inter-company agreements.
* Comply with relevant data protection legislation.
* Be subject to safeguards equivalent to those described in this Policy.


### **7.3 Legal and Regulatory Authorities**

We may disclose personal data when required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable government requests.

**Examples of such disclosures include:**

* Responding to court orders, subpoenas, or regulatory inquiries.
* Complying with UK tax, financial, or anti-money laundering laws.
* Cooperating with law enforcement in cases involving fraud, misuse, or harm.

We will always assess the legality and proportionality of any request and will, where permitted, notify you unless prohibited by law.


### **7.4 Business Transfers and Transactions**

In the event that DsReplay is involved in a business transition—such as a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, sale of assets, or insolvency—your personal data may be transferred as part of the transaction, subject to confidentiality protections.

**We will ensure that:**

* The recipient entity is contractually bound to this Privacy Policy (or a materially equivalent policy).
* You are notified of any changes to the ownership or data control status.
* Your rights remain unaffected and enforceable.


### **7.5 Third-Party Integrations and APIs**

Where you choose to connect your DsReplay account with third-party platforms (e.g., through OAuth integrations such as Deriv), we may share or receive limited personal data necessary to authenticate and operate those connections.

**Important:**

* You control whether these integrations are enabled.
* Any data shared with or by such third parties is subject to their respective privacy policies.
* DsReplay disclaims responsibility for the privacy practices of such third-party services outside the scope of our integration.


### **7.6 Public or Community Forums (If Applicable)**

If DsReplay provides community features such as public profiles, leaderboards, or forums:

* Information you choose to publish voluntarily (e.g., username, strategies, messages) may become visible to others.
* You should take care not to share personal or sensitive information in such areas.
* We provide controls to manage visibility and anonymisation where applicable.


### **7.7 With Your Consent**

In all other cases not covered above, we will not share your data with third parties unless you provide clear, informed, and explicit consent.

**Example:**

* Participating in a case study or user testimonial programme.
* Opting into promotional partnerships or referral programmes.

You may withdraw consent at any time, and we will cease such processing or sharing unless there is another lawful basis.


### **7.8 Data Protection Agreements and Safeguards**

Wherever data is shared with external parties, we:

* Use **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)** with processors.
* Ensure compliance with **UK GDPR Chapter V** for international transfers.
* Require **standard contractual clauses (SCCs)** or UK Addenda where applicable.
* Conduct due diligence on each partner’s security, data handling, and privacy reputation.


## **8. International Data Transfers**

DsReplay is committed to ensuring that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with UK data protection legislation, regardless of where it is processed. Where your personal data is transferred outside the **United Kingdom (UK)** or the **European Economic Area (EEA)**, we ensure an adequate level of protection consistent with **Chapter V of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)** and the **Data Protection Act 2018**.

This section sets out how we approach international data transfers, including to countries without an adequacy decision from the UK Government.

### **8.1 Where Transfers May Occur**

As a digital platform, DsReplay may store, process, or transfer personal data outside the UK and EEA in the following circumstances:

* Use of third-party service providers whose servers are located in countries such as the United States, Canada, or Singapore.
* Intra-group transfers where DsReplay is part of a corporate structure with international offices or affiliates.
* Cross-border access by support, engineering, or legal teams for operational or compliance purposes.
* Execution of global partnerships or integrations where the service provider operates internationally.


### **8.2 Adequacy Decisions**

The UK Government may designate certain countries as providing an **adequate level of data protection**, meaning your data can be transferred to those jurisdictions without further safeguards.

As of the date of this Policy, adequacy regulations exist for jurisdictions such as:

* European Union and EEA Member States
* Switzerland
* Canada (commercial organisations)
* Japan
* New Zealand
* South Korea

**Where applicable**, we rely on such adequacy decisions under **UK GDPR Article 45** to legitimise transfers.


### **8.3 Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and the UK Addendum**

For transfers to countries **not covered by an adequacy decision**, we implement **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** adopted by the European Commission and recognised by the UK Government, together with the **UK Addendum**, to ensure appropriate contractual safeguards.

These clauses:

* Bind the recipient to strict data protection principles;
* Prohibit onward transfer without equivalent safeguards;
* Provide enforceable rights and remedies for data subjects.

Where relevant, we conduct **Transfer Risk Assessments (TRAs)** and may implement additional security measures (such as encryption or pseudonymisation) to supplement the SCCs.


### **8.4 Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)**

If DsReplay becomes part of a corporate group operating under **Binding Corporate Rules**, these may be used to legitimise internal transfers between group companies. At present, DsReplay does not rely on BCRs but reserves the right to adopt them in future subject to UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) approval.


### **8.5 Specific Exceptions (Derogations)**

In exceptional cases, we may rely on specific derogations under **UK GDPR Article 49** where no other transfer mechanism is available. These include:

* Your **explicit consent**, with full transparency of risks;
* Transfers **necessary for the performance of a contract**, e.g., delivering services to an international user;
* **Legal claims or defences**, or
* **Public interest grounds** recognised in UK law.

These are used sparingly and only where no safer mechanism applies.


### **8.6 Security Measures During Transfer**

Regardless of the transfer mechanism, DsReplay ensures that:

* All transfers are encrypted during transmission (e.g., via TLS).
* Data minimisation principles are applied.
* Access is limited to authorised personnel with strict role-based controls.
* Audit logs are maintained to monitor international access or replication.


### **8.7 User Rights and Remedies**

You retain all your **UK GDPR rights** even when your data is transferred internationally, including:

* The right to be informed of such transfers;
* The right to access and request a copy of your transferred data;
* The right to object to certain transfers or withdraw consent where applicable;
* The right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).


### **8.8 Contact for International Transfer Queries**

If you have any questions about how your data is transferred or would like further details of specific safeguards, you may contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) at:

📧 **Email**: [dslabs@dsreplay.com](mailto:dslabs@dsreplay.com)
✍️ **Subject**: *International Data Transfers*


## **9. Data Retention and Storage**

At DsReplay, we are committed to retaining your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, or to comply with legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations. We implement clear retention schedules and secure storage practices to ensure your data’s integrity, confidentiality, and availability.


### **9.1 Retention Principles**

* **Purpose Limitation:** Data is retained solely to achieve the original purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.
* **Minimal Retention:** We do not keep personal data longer than necessary.
* **Compliance:** Retention periods reflect statutory or regulatory requirements (e.g., financial records retention).
