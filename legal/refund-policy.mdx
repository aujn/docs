1.2. The provision of refunds is subject to strict scrutiny and is only granted in exceptional circumstances as outlined herein.

- Such rights may override the strict terms of this Policy where mandatory.
- Customers must notify DsReplay within the statutory period to exercise these rights.

### 7.2 Middle East

- Customers in Middle Eastern jurisdictions are subject to local consumer protection laws, which may vary widely.
- DsReplay complies with all applicable laws but maintains its right to limit refunds as per this Policy, subject to mandatory local regulations.

## 8. **Limitations of Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, DsReplay disclaims all liability for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages arising from payment or refund issues.
