DsReplay is a next-generation backtesting and simulation platform tailored specifically for synthetic indices traders. Whether you're a retail trader refining your edge, a proprietary desk simulating strategy performance, or a fintech building automated strategies, DsReplay empowers you to test, visualize, and iterate with precision and speed.

## Why DsReplay?

In synthetic markets, where traditional asset behaviors don't apply and volatility is constantâ€”precision backtesting is non-negotiable. DsReplay offers a fully simulated trading environment that mimics live market conditions for synthetic indices such as Volatility Index (VIX), Crash/Boom, Jump Indices, and Range Breakouts, enabling you to:

    - Rewind and replay market sessions as though they were happening live.

    - Place and manage trades in a risk-free environment with real-world conditions.

    - Analyze strategies over time using intuitive timelines, performance metrics, and session replays.

## Who Is DsReplay For?

    - **Independent Traders**: Test strategies with zero financial risk and full control over the timeline.

    - **Trading Firms & Desks**: Train teams, stress-test strategies, and archive sessions for performance reviews.

    - **Quant & Algo Developers**: Replay markets while running algorithmic simulations in a contained environment.

    - **Educators & Mentors**: Use replay as a visual teaching tool to demonstrate high-quality setups.

## What Makes Synthetic Indices Backtesting Different?

Synthetic indices, unlike traditional forex or equities, operate 24/7 with no external market influence. They are generated algorithmically to follow specific statistical properties, demanding specialized tooling for proper analysis. DsReplay provides the granular control, time-series simulation, and high-frequency replay these instruments require.
